# Melt Rates
WAVI.jl has a number of community melt rate parametrizations/models (referred to here collectively as 'melt rates') implemented and ready to use. Details of the physics of these models can be found on the [melt rate physics page](../physics/melting.md). This page provides a description of how to endow ice sheet models with a melt rate model/parametrization, as well as the interface of each of those that are implemented in WAVI.jl.

## Adding a Melt Rate to a WAVI.jl Model
Melt rates is WAVI.jl are interfaced via `MeltRate` objects. To build an ice sheet model with a melt rate, simply build the appropriate `MeltRate` object and then pass it to the `Model` when the latter is constructed.

This is best demonstrated by example: we first build a simple ice sheet model on a 20 x 20 grid, with a bed that is 50 m below sea level:
```julia
grid = Grid(nx = 20, ny = 20)
bed_elevation = 50.0 * ones(grid.nx, grid.ny)
```
We then build our melt rate model. Let consider a simple case in which the [melt rate is assumed to depend quadratically on the thermal forcing](#Quadratic-Melt-Rate):
```julia
melt_rate = QuadraticMeltRate();
```
Finally, build the ice sheet model and pass the melt rate model
```julia
model = Model(grid = grid, bed_elevation = bed_elevation, melt_rate = melt_rate)
```

## Quadratic Melt Rate
A `QuadraticMeltModel` -- the melt rate used to implement the [quadratic temperature melt rate parametrization](../physics/melting.md#Quadratic-Temperature-Melt-Rate-Parametrization) is constructed using the `QuadraticMeltModel(<kwargs>)` constructor. 

A `QuadraticMeltModel` accepts the following keyword arguments:
- `h` (required): array of ice thickness values at grid points
- `melt_partial_cell` (default: `false`): specify whether to apply melt to partially floating cells or not.
- `lambda_1` (default: `-0.057`): liquidus slope
- `lambda_2` (default: `0.0832`): liquidus intercept
- `lambda_3` (default: `7.59e-4`): liquidus pressure coefficient.
- `gamma_T` (default `99.32e-5`): heat exchange velocity. Note that `gamma_T` is typically used as a tuning parameter, the default value is the tuned value from [Favier2019](@cite).
- `L` (default `3.35e-5`): latent heat of fusion
- `rho_s` (default `1028.0`): sea water density
- `rho_i` (default `918.0`): ice density
- `c_p` (default 3974.0): specific heat capacity of ocean
- `S_0`: far-field practical salinity profile (units: psu), passed to the constructor as a function of depth. The default is the 'warm0' profile used in [Favier2019](@cite).
- `T_0`: far-field potential temperature profile (units: ${}^\circ$C), passed to the constructor as a function of depth. The default is the 'warm0' profile used in [Favier2019](@cite).

Ambient temperature and salinity profiles are passed to `PlumeEmulator` objects via the `Ta` and `Sa` keyword arguments, respectively. These must be passed as single valued functions of depth (i.e. temporal dependence in the ambient conditions is not yet supported). `Ta` and `Sa` default to the warm ambient profiles used in ISOMIP experiments (referred to as 'warm0' therein), with a lower layer of temperature 1.2∘C and salinity 34.6PSU separated from an upper layer of temperature -1∘C and salinity 33.8PSU by a pycnocline of thickness 400m, which begins at a depth of 700m below sea level.

## Plume Emulator Melt Rates
The [plume model emulator](../physics/melting.md#Plume-Emulator-Melt-Rate) of Lazeroms2018 is implemented via a `PlumeEmulator` object. Parameters used in plume model emulator melt rates are specified by keyword arguments passed to `PlumeEmulator` objects; these summarized in the following table:
