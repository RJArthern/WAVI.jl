# Installation instructions

You can install the latest version of Oceananigans using the built-in package manager (accessed by pressing `]` in the
Julia command prompt) to add the package and instantiate/build all dependencies

```julia
julia>]
(v1.6) pkg> add https://github.com/RJArthern/WAVI.jl
(v1.6) pkg> instantiate
```

Note that WAVI is only tested on Julia versions 1.5 and newer; stability cannot be guaranteed on newer versions!

At this time, updating should be done with care, as WAVI is under rapid development. While we take care to avoid breaking changes, they may happen during this time. If anything does break, please open an issue and let us know!
