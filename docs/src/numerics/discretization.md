# Discretization
To include here:
- Brief details of how the momentum equations are transformed into a problem $\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{\bar{u}}) = \mathbf{f}$ if the viscosity is known (and say that in practice, we iterate to find the viscosity, see velocity solve)
- Discretization of this problem (write down matrix problem and operators)
