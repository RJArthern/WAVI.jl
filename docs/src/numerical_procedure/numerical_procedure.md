# Numerical Grid
WAVI.jl solves the [governing equations](../physics/governing_equations.md) on a rectangular grid, with $n_x$ grid cells in the $x$ direction and $n_y$ grid cells in the $y$ direction. Ice thickness values $h$ are defined at the cell centers (see figure) of grid cells, while velocity components $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are defined along grid cell edges, and shear strain rates $c = (\partial u /\partial y + \partial v / \partial x)/2$ are stored at grid corners.

The set of all such points at which the ice thickness is stored defines the $h$-grid. The $u$-grid, $v$-grid, and $c$-grid are defined analagously. Various different quantities are also stored on each of these grids, and used as part of the solution (see [Fields](../data_structure/fields.md) for more information).

Three dimensional fields used in the governing equations (e.g. viscosity) are stored $h$-grid points, extrapolated into the $z$ direction. This grid is referred to as the $\sigma$-grid.

# Problem Reduction
This section contains brief details of the procedure by which the momentum balance equations [governing equations](../physics/governing_equations.md)(2)--(4) are reduced to a non-linear equation for the depth average velocity $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. For full details, refer to [Arthern2015](@cite).

To make progress in solving the [governing equations](../physics/governing_equations.md), horizontal gradients in vertical velocity are neglected and vertical shear stresses are assumed to vary linearly with depth. Then, if the ice thickness $h$, surface elevation $h$, ice stiffness, basal stresses and horizontal stress components are known, the depth integrated viscosity 
```math
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\eta} = \frac{1}{h}\int_{s - h}^{h} \eta~\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation}
```
can be computed numerically. Here $\eta$ is the ice viscosity (equation (4) in the[governing equations](../physics/governing_equations.md)).

After depth integrating the approximation to the horizonal stress components, and using the Robin boundary condition (equation (7)), the basal velocity components -- and thus basal stress terms -- can be expressed in terms of the depth averaged velocity components. The basal stress components can then be eliminated from  [governing equations](../physics/governing_equations.md)(2)--(3), which can therefore be expressed as a non-linear problem for $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, the depth averaged velocity:
```math
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\bar{\mathbf{u}}) \bar{\mathbf{u}} = \mathbf{f}
\end{equation}
```
where
```math
\begin{equation}\label{E:operator_problem}
\mathcal{L} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\partial_{x} 4 \bar{\eta} h \partial_{x} + \partial_{y}  \bar{\eta} h \partial_{y} - \beta_{\text{eff}} & \partial_{x} 2 \bar{\eta} h \partial_{y} + \partial_{y}  \bar{\eta} h \partial_{x} \\
\partial_{x} \bar{\eta} h \partial_{y} + \partial_{y} 2  \bar{\eta} h \partial_{x} & \partial_x  \bar{\eta} h \partial_x + \partial_y 4 \bar{\eta} h \partial_y - \beta_{\text{eff}} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
```
with $\beta_{\text{eff}}$ an effective drag coefficient (see equation (12) in [Arthern2015](@cite)).

# Velocity Solve
This section described very briefly the steps involved in the procedure by which the non-linear elliptic problem for the velocity (equation \eqref{E:operator_problem}) is solved in `WAVI.jl`. Again, for full details, refer to [Arthern2015](@cite).

- The problem \eqref{E:operator_problem} is discretized with a finite difference approximation. Details of the discretization are included in the appendix of [Arthern2015](@cite). 
- The resulting problem is expressed as a symmetric saddle point problem. 
- The saddle point problem is expressed as two distinct problems. The first is solver iteratively using a [BiCGSTAB method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method)
- The second problem is solved using an iterative method, leveraging an [LU-factorization] of the mass matrix in the problem.

# Timestepping
If the system is to be solved forwards in time, the velocity must be solved simultanously with the surface elevation (i.e. equations (2)--(4) and (8)) must be solved simultanously. The procedure is largely as described above for the velocity components, but the problem is preconditioned using an iterative approach inspired by [Vasilyev2005](@cite) to improve computational speed. Once the velocities have been solved for, the surface elecation is updated using a simple Euler scheme.
