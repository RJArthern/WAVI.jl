# Overview
WAVI.jl is a software package for the numerical solution of the [hybrid equations](governing_equations.md) describing the evolution of ice sheet thickness $h$ and velocity $\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$. Hybrid models assume that ice sheet stresses are depth independent, but vertical velocity gradients are included in the non-linear viscosity and treatment of basal stress. This means that unlike models that make the [shallow-ice](#Shallow-Ice-Models) or [shallow-shelf](#Shallow-Shelf-Models) approximations, they are appropriate to describe both regions of fast and slow ice flow, while being computationally two-dimensional and thus far less expensive than [full Stokes](#Full-Stokes-Models) models. See our [background to ice sheet models](#Backgrond-to-Ice-Sheet-Models) below.
